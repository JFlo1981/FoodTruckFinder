## Description

Food Truck Finder is a full-stack MERN app that uses the Google Maps and Yelp APIs to let you search for a Food Truck and returns results of Food Trucks in the area searched. The search results are displayed with the Food Trucks title, image and description. You can signup to create a username and save your favorite Trucks to display in the user Dashboard. The saved Food Trucks are persistent and will still show up when you log out and return to the app.

This app was refactored from an existing, fully functional MERN app setup with a RESTful API and refactored the existing RESTful API to a GraphQL API using Apollo Server with GraphQL queries and mutations along with MongoDB, Express, React and Node. Refactoring to a GraphQL API allows for less calls to the server and avoids overfetching of data.
